### [Structural](structural)

Structural design patterns deal with object composition or the way objects are structured to form larger structures.
They help to ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire structure doesn't need to change.
These patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures, simplifying the design by identifying relationships between entities.
Structural patterns often use inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.

- **Class-level patterns**
    Class-level patterns describe interactions between classes and their subclasses.
    These relationships are expressed through inheritance and class implementation.
    Here, the base class defines the interface, while subclasses provide the implementation.

- **Object-level patterns**
    Object-level patterns describe interactions between objects.
    These relationships are expressed through [associations](../README.md#association), [aggregation](../README.md#aggregation), and [composition](../README.md#composition).
    Structures are built by combining objects of certain classes, allowing for dynamic and flexible designs.
