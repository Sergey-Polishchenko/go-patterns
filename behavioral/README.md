## Behavioral

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
They focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other, ensuring that objects can work together in a flexible and maintainable way.
These patterns help to define the ways in which objects interact and distribute responsibility, making it easier to manage complex control flows and communication between objects.

- **Class-level patterns**
    Class-level patterns describe interactions between classes and their subclasses.
    These relationships are expressed through inheritance and class implementation.
    The base class defines the interface, while subclasses provide the implementation.

- **Object-level patterns**
    Object-level patterns describe interactions between objects.
    These relationships are expressed through [associations](../README.md#association), [aggregation](../README.md#aggregation), and [composition](../README.md#composition).
    Structures are built by combining objects of certain classes, enabling dynamic and flexible behavior.
