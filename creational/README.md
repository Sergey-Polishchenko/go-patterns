### [Creational](creational)

Creational design patterns are concerned with the way objects are created.
They help to make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
They abstract the instantiation process, making it easier to introduce new types of objects without changing the existing code.

- **Class-level patterns**
    Class-level patterns change the class of the created object through inheritance.
    These patterns define how objects are instantiated by delegating the responsibility to subclasses.

- **Object-level patterns**
    Object-level patterns create new objects by using other objects.
    These patterns focus on delegating the instantiation process to another object, promoting flexibility and decoupling.
